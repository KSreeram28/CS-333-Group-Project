# Predictive Capabilities and Challenges of Risk-Prediction Algorithms in Clinical Settings
### CS 333 Technical Demo
Risk Prediction Algorithms in Healthcare

The goal for our technical demo is to simulate an actual risk-prediction algorithm for health data and evaluate its performance, as well as tease apart some of the inherent biases present in these models when considering race and various other intersectionalities. In a model similar to that of Obermeyer et al. (2019), we are adapting and applying different risk-prediction models to a dataset.
